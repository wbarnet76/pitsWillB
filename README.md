# Planing 
## intial ideas

* Trebuchet
    * Pros - High power
    * Cons - Lots of moving parts 
* Moon Shoes
    * Pros - Fun, creative
    * Cons - difucult to visualize

### Chosen idea
We diceided to do Moon Shoes due to their unique design and fun idea.
## Materials add links to pics of each 
* 4x 1/4in plywood 
* 2x 5x10in wood block
* 4x 2in springs 
* 4x 4in carraige bolt
    * 4x nuts 
* 2x hiking boots
* 9x 1/4in wood screws

## Safety measures
The orignal moon shoes had one big problem. They had a high chance to injure the wearer's ankles. To mitagate this, we chose to use hiking boots as a base for their builtin ankle protection.

## Early Prototype
Even in the early stages of this project, we  decided to move away from the original moon shoes design due to its high risk of injury. I started the prototype with a platform to stand the boot on. Then I drilled holes in the bottom of the platform to house springs. Next, I built an enclosure for the platform, ensuring little to no movement aside from vertical movement.

## Prototype Pt2
Starting out with the second prototype, I traced my shoes to create a new platform, cutting the traced area out with a bandsaw then taking it to the chop saw to cut it along a line that I had drawn to show where my foot would bend when I jumped. Then I drilled three holes through each side of the cut and threaded a string through the holes in a criss cross pattern to create an articulated part of the platform.

## Final Boot Prep
To get the boots ready for the final design, I had to set them up on the drill press to drill relief holes for the carriage bolts so that the springs could compress. I drilled in the places that the bolts would push up into. Then in between the holes I put a 1in tall 5in wide x 10 in long piece of wood to give a little extra space between the platform and the boots.

## Final Platform Prep 
In my final design I used the cut out idea in the previous prototype but I did not use the string to articulate it. I made four cut outs per foot to the base and platform of wach foot. Then used the drill press to create a hole half way thru the plywood. I saved the “pucks” that the drill press creates when it drills all the way thru the wood. I used these “pucks” by putting them in the hole that I made half way through the plywood and I filled the gaps with hot glue to create a mold. I put the springs in the mold which holds them in the hole and reduces their horizontal movement. Then i drilled a hole thru the middle of the space that the spring sits in and put the carriage bolt thru it to hold all the pieces together.
