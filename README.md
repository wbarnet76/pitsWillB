# Planing 
## intial ideas

* Trebuchet
    * Pros - High power
    * Cons - Lots of moving parts 
* Moon Shoes
    * Pros - Fun, creative
    * Cons - difucult to visualize

### Chosen idea
We diceided to do Moon Shoes due to their unique design and fun idea.
## Materials add links to pics of each 
* 4x 1/4in plywood 
* 2x 5x10in wood block
* 4x 2in springs 
* 4x 4in carraige bolt
    * 4x nuts 
* 2x hiking boots
* 9x 1/4in wood screws

## Safety measures
The orignal moon shoes had one big problem it had a high chance to injure the weareras ankles. to mitagate this we chose to use hiking boots, as a base, for their ankle protection

## Early Prototype
Even in the early stages of this project we had decided to move away from the original moon shoes design due to its high risk of injury. I started the prototype out with a platform to stand on, then I drilled holes in the bottom of the platform to house springs. Then I built an enclosure for the platform, ensuring little to no movement aside from vertical movement.

## Prototype Pt2
Starting out with the second prototype I traced my shoes to create the new platform, cutting the traced area out with a bandsaw then taking it to the chop saw to cut it down a line that I had drawn to show where my foot would bend when I jumped. Then I drilled three holes through each side of the cut  and threaded a string through the holes in a criss cross pattern to create an articulated part of the platform.

# Final Design

## Final Boot Prep
To get the boots ready for the final I had to set them up on the drill press to drill relief holes for the carriage  bolts for when the springs compress so I drilled in the places that the bolts would push up into. Then in between the holes I drilled put a 1in tall 5x10in wide piece of wood to give a little extra height to the boots.

## Final Platform Prep 
In my final design I used the cut out idea in the previous prototype but I did not use the string to articulate it. I made cut outs per foot then used the drill press to create a hole half way thru the plywood then I made a “puck” that the drill press creates when it's drilled all the way thru the wood. I used these “pucks” by putting them in the hole that I made half way through the plywood and I filled the gaps with hot glue to create a mold. I  put the springs in the mold and that holds them in the holde and reduces the horizontal movement. Then i drilled a hole thru the middle of the space that the spring sits in and put the carriage bolt thru it
